// Private school organises school camps during school holidays. Depending on the vacation (spring, summer or winter) and the type of group (girls, boys or mixed)
//the price of the nights in the hotel as well as the sport that they would practiced is different.
//                              Winter	    Spring	    Summer
// boys/girls	                  9.60	    7.20	    15
// mixed	                       10	    9.50	    20
// The school gets a discount depending on the number of students:
//50 or more students, 50% discount
//20 or more and less than 50, 15% discount
//10 or more and less than 20, 5% discount
//The table below describes the sports that the group would practice:
//                          Winter	         Spring	            Summer
// girls                    Gymnastics	    Athletics	    Volleyball

// mixed	                Ski	             Cycling	      Swimming
//Write a programme that calculates the cost of the vacation which the School would pay and prints the sport, which the students would play.
