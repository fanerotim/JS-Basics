//Write a programme which calculates how much it would cost a driver to fill in the reservoir of his vehicle
//when you know the type of fuel he uses, the price of the fuel per litre and if the driver has a discount card. 
//Costs of the fuels are:
//Gasoline - 2.22 per litre
//Diesel - 2.33 per litre
//Gas - 0.93 per litre
//If the driver has a discount card, he uses the following discounts per litre of fuel: 0.18 gasoline, 0.12 diesel, 0.08 gas.
//If the driver has refuelled between 20 to 25 litres, he gets 8 percent discount from the final price. 
//If he refuells more than 25 litres, then he gets 10 percent discount from the final price. 
//Input: 1. Type of fuel; 2. Amount of fuel; 3. Possession of club/discount card;
//Expected Output:â€¢	"{final price of fuel} lv." - result must be rounded to two decimal points
